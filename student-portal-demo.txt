# student-portal-demo

## Project Idea

The Student Portal Demo is a web application designed to provide students with a centralized hub for managing their academic life. The portal aims to simplify access to course materials, grades, announcements, and school events, enhancing the overall student experience.

## Key Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure login for both students and administrators.
*   **Student Dashboard:** A personalized view for each student, showing their enrolled courses, recent grades, and upcoming deadlines.
*   **Course Management:** A section where students can access course syllabi, assignments, and lecture notes.
*   **Grade Viewing:** A private area for students to check their grades for individual assignments and overall course performance.
*   **Announcements:** A bulletin board for school-wide or course-specific announcements.
*   **Calendar:** An integrated calendar to keep track of important dates, such as assignment due dates and exams.

## Technology Stack (Proposed)

*   **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic, single-page application experience.
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django/Flask for a RESTful API.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.
*   **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.

## Getting Started

This repository is set up to provide a starting point for development. More detailed installation and usage instructions will be added as the project progresses.
